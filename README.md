# AutomatedBalancingRobot
The Automated Balancing Robot was a project wherein a two-wheeled robot was built and programmed to be radio controlled from an Android app while being tasked with self balancing.
This project used Matlab to calculate the perfect PD controller (from an original PID controller structure) and C++ coding language in order to make sure the robot was programmed to
achieve the deired balancing and radio controlled actions.
